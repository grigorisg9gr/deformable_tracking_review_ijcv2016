* train_shape_predictors_on_presaved_images_bb.ipynb : Trains the landmark localisation models on images from public datasets with pre-saved bounding boxes.
* run_online_tracking_by_detection.ipynb : Runs the (python) detectors (on the testset) and on top of them a landmark localisation method and exports the bounding boxes and the landmarks. 
* tracker_from_previous_all_methods. ipynb : Perform tracking from the previous frame (on the testset).
